# Adaptive_Micro_Pairs
An implementation of a regime-adaptive pairs trading framework for commodity-linked equities (EWA/EWC). The system utilizes a Kalman Filter for dynamic hedge-ratio estimation and a Random Forest classifier to gate entries using Copper and Oil leads. Designed to mitigate beta-drift and structural decoupling through non-linear macro filtering.
